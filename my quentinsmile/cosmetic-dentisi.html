                        as a complete smile makeover.

Dr. Khabensky makes the teeth bonding material out of a durable plastic resin, just one office visit. Most dental bonding lasts up to 10 years.

                <p>As cosmetic dental specialists, the Family Cosmetic & Implant Dentistry team was voted one of
                    America’s best dentists in 2018. The father/son team places the highest priority on your comfort,
                    and that attention to detail shows. Whether you’re concerned about cosmetic dentistry cost or the
                    pain of a particular dental procedure, the dentists don’t do anything until you understand and agree
                    with the treatment plan.</p>


                <p>Family dentistry that also offers restorative dentistry, the team treats everyone in your family with
                    the services that you may associate with a general dentist, including:</p>

                <ul class="cosmitic-list">
                    <li>Teeth cleaning</li>
                    <li>Porcelain fillings</li>

                <!-- two -->
                <h2>Board Certified Cosmetic Dentist</h2>

                <p>As a top New York dentist in 2018, your Brooklyn general dentist graduated from NYU and is certified
                    by the World Clinical Laser Institute. Our dentists are members of the <a href="https://aacd.com/"
                        target="_blank">American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry</a> and the <a
                        href="https://www.ada.org/en" target="_blank"> American Dental Association.</a></p>
                <p>The best cosmetic dentists focus on aesthetic training in addition to general dentistry. Many
                    cosmetic procedures are elective, which means you only get them to improve your appearance. Our
                    dentists understand the value of appearance in how you follow through with your overall dental
                    health too, which is why they’ve received numerous accolades for Excellence in Customer Service.</p>
                <p class="cosmitic-btm-margin">This father-son family dentist serves everyone from toddlers with their
                    first tooth eruption to teens and seniors.</p>

                <h2>Restorative Dentistry for the Whole Family</h2>

                <p>We always focus first on your oral health. Your teeth and gums must be in the best condition possible
                    before you take on new cosmetic dentistry costs. You’ll reach the dazzling smile you deserve when
                    your mouth is healthy and pain-free.</p>
                <p class="cosmitic-btm-margin">Sometimes, cosmetic dentistry procedures must be taken even after your
                    routine oral care is completed. You can count on your Brooklyn-based cosmetic dentist to provide you
                    with safe, effective restorative treatments and dental procedures that may involve dental implants,
                    gum disease treatment, teeth extractions, bone grafts, and gum graft.</p>

                <!-- four -->
                <h2>Cosmetic Dentistry Cost</h2>

                <p>Your cosmetic dentist doesn’t charge any more for your standard general dentistry procedures like
                    fillings and x-rays than a traditional family dentist. We are always aware of your budget restraints
                    and your personal goals, so make sure you relate all that relevant information during your
                    consultations.</p>
                <p class="cosmitic-btm-margin cosmitic-btm-margin-0">You must be aware, however, that it’s difficult if
                    not impossible to put a price on a winning smile, especially if you’re in the performance community
                    in New York City or in another profession that requires public interaction. Children and their
                    evolving self-esteem often rely on appearance as well. And while your dental insurance may cover
                    routine and medically necessary dental services, cosmetic elective procedures usually require a much
                    higher out-of-pocket investment.</p>
